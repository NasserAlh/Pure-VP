# POC from Docker and VSCode Bookmap Add-on

The add-on "POC from Docker and VSCode" is a custom trading module developed for the Bookmap trading platform. This module is coded in Java and designed to run within a Docker container, allowing for ease of development and deployment via Visual Studio Code. The main goal of this add-on is to track and visualize price, volume, and Point of Control (POC) data in real-time, providing traders with valuable insights to make informed decisions.

## Features:

1. **Real-Time Indicators**:
   - Tracks and visualizes real-time price, volume, and Point of Control (POC) data.
   - Displays these indicators on primary and bottom graph types within the Bookmap interface.

2. **Volume Profile Analysis**:
   - Maintains a volume profile to analyze the distribution of trading volume at different price levels over time.
   - Identifies the Point of Control (POC), the price level with the highest traded volume.

3. **Trade Signal Generation**:
   - Generates trade signals based on the movement of price relative to the Point of Control (POC).
   - Signals are visually represented by translucent circles on the chart.

4. **Customizable Settings**:
   - Provides a settings panel for users to customize the tick distance from POC, aiding in tailoring the add-on to individual trading strategies.

5. **Timestamp Management**:
   - Handles timestamps to ensure accurate time-based data analysis.
   - Converts timestamps to New York time to align with the standard trading hours.

## Usage:

The `PocTrading` class is the main class implementing the `CustomModule`, `TradeDataListener`, `TimeListener`, and `CustomSettingsPanelProvider` interfaces provided by the Bookmap API. These interfaces allow the add-on to interact with live trading data, react to time updates, and provide a custom settings panel for user configuration.

### Initialization:

The `initialize` method is called upon loading the add-on, setting up the necessary indicators and their respective colors.

### Trade Data Handling:

The `onTrade` method is triggered on receiving new trade data. It updates the indicators, maintains the volume profile, calculates the Point of Control (POC), and checks the conditions for generating trade signals based on price movements relative to the POC.

### Trade Signal Visualization:

Translucent circles representing trade signals are created and added to the chart through the `createTranslucentCircle` method.

### Custom Settings Panel:

The `getCustomSettingsPanels` method provides a settings panel allowing users to customize the tick distance from POC via a slider.

### Time Handling:

The `onTimestamp` method updates the current timestamp, crucial for time-based analysis and trade signal generation.

## Settings Panel:

A settings panel named "Settings Ticks distance from POC" is provided for users to adjust the `POC_BUFFER` value which determines the tick distance from POC for trade signal generation. This value can be adjusted via a slider, providing a simple and intuitive user interface for customization.

The code structure is well-organized and straightforward, making it easy to understand and extend for further customization or additional functionality. By encapsulating the trading logic within a Docker container and allowing for development via Visual Studio Code, this add-on exemplifies a modern approach to creating custom trading modules for the Bookmap platform.

The critical takeaway is that this Bookmap add-on is designed to calculate and display the Point of Control (POC) while taking into account a buffer distance from the POC for trade signaling. It listens to trade and time data, and incorporates a settings panel for user input. It also uses various indicators to visualize data on the Bookmap chart.

### Code Breakdown:

#### Import Statements and Annotations
- Importing necessary libraries and using annotations to make this class a Bookmap Custom Module.
  
#### Instance Variables
- `Indicator`: Various indicators for price, volume, and POC.
- `ConcurrentSkipListMap`: To maintain the volume profile.
- `POC_BUFFER`: A volatile variable that determines the buffer range around the POC.
- `TIME_LIMIT`: Time frame for which to evaluate the data (120 seconds in nanoseconds).
  
#### `initialize` Method
- Registers indicators and sets their colors.

#### `onTrade` Method
- Listens to trade events, calculates and updates the POC.
- Uses the buffer around the POC to possibly generate a trade signal based on price movements.
- Checks that the trade event occurs after 9:45 am New York time.

#### `createTranslucentCircle` Method
- Generates an icon for trade signals, using a semi-transparent circle.
  
#### `getCustomSettingsPanels` Method
- Creates a settings panel to control the value of `POC_BUFFER` via a slider.
  
#### `onTimestamp` Method
- Keeps track of the current timestamp.

#### `stop` Method
- Empty implementation as it's required by the interface.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Code Efficiency**: Use functional programming features to streamline the code further. For example, the color setting in the `initialize` method could be done in a more functional way.
2. **Trading Strategy**: Consider adding more sophisticated trading rules that factor in additional indicators or market conditions.
3. **User Experience**: Add more custom settings panels for additional user configurations.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error-handling strategies to deal with various edge cases.

#### Questions:
1. Have you considered incorporating moving averages or other indicators along with POC for a more nuanced trading strategy?
2. How would you optimize the code to run more efficiently, especially in a high-frequency trading environment?

I hope this gives you a clear understanding of the Bookmap add-on's code. Feel free to ask for any further clarification.
